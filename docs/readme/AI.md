# AI Development Tools

We leverage AI-powered development tools, specifically Cursor and Codeium, to enhance our coding workflow and maintain high code quality standards.

## Our Approach:

- Utilizing Cursor for rapid test generation and validation
- Leveraging Codeium's intelligent code completion for faster development
- Using AI assistance for code refactoring and optimization

## Best Practices:

- Always validate AI-generated code with comprehensive test coverage
- Maintain human oversight for critical security implementations
- Use AI as a development accelerator, not a replacement for expertise
- Ensure AI-generated code follows our established patterns and standards
- Set clear guidelines for AI to maintain consistent code structure

## Implementation Strategy:

- Use Cursor for generating test cases based on business requirements
- Leverage Codeium for code completion while maintaining control over implementation
- Apply AI suggestions as a starting point for further refinement
- Keep human review as the final quality gate for all code changes

This approach helps us maintain code quality while accelerating development through AI assistance.
